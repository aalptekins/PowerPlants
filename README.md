# PowerPlants
In this project, power plants from all over the world are analyzed.

- I used SQL and Python to analyze raw data.
- The dataset was not clear enough to analyze, so with using pandas I created a new dataset which is more readeble.
- I used SQL to create table for my tableau dashboard. 
- I created a dashboard in Tableau Public
